# Vehicle Routing Problem with Private fleet and Common carrier

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?" It generalises the travelling salesman problem (TSP). It first appeared in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959, in which the first algorithmic approach was written and was applied to petrol deliveries. Often, the context is that of delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods. The objective of the VRP is to minimize the total route cost. In 1964, Clarke and Wright improved on Dantzig and Ramser's approach using an effective greedy algorithm called the savings algorithm.

The vehicle-routing problem with private fleet and common carrier (VRPPC) is a variant of the VRP in which customers can be subcontracted at a customer-dependent cost if the privately-owned capacity is insufficient to serve all customers, or if doing so is beneficial from a cost point of view. Consequently, the subcontracted customers do not need to be served on vehicle routes of the privately-owned fleet, but a cost is paid for outsourcing customers to the so-called common carrier.
